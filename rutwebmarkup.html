    <h3>ideas around <strong>rut web markup</strong></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>file extension: .rutwm</li>
        <li>types like shortcuts in vscode
            <ul>
                <li>li {list item}</li>
                <li>basically to avoid starting and ending tags</li>
                <li>or like li < p as in css</li>
                <li>css is really the model for this, it is done very well and cleanly</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>need to understand how to identify keywords
            <ul>
                <li>in html anything inside the brackets is a keyword
                     it could be anything (and should be)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>but it totally needs to not give a shit about whitespace, which html currently does</li>
    </ul>
