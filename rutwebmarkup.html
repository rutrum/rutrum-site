        <h3>ideas around <strong>rut web markup</strong></h3>
        
        <a href="test.rutwm">click here for an example of the syntax</a>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>WHAT LANGUAGE DO I PROGRAM THIS IN?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>I don't believe that javascript can read files without an advanced plugin. <br />
                        I need something that can read files easily.  Java is the only one I comfortable with :(</li>
                    <li><strong>PYTHON</strong> it shall be.  Should be a fun experiment learning a new programming language.
                        <ul>
                            <li>It's okay..</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>file extension: .rutwm</li>
            <li>types like shortcuts in vscode
                <ul>
                    <li>li {list item}</li>
                    <li>basically to avoid starting and ending tags</li>
                    <li>or like li < p as in css</li>
                    <li>css is really the model for this, it is done very well and cleanly</li>
                    <li>also classes and ids should be done as so: p.code#top with a special key (say ^) for styling, etc</li>
                    <li>then there also needs to be optional parameters for other attributes as well, maybe like params on a function</li>
                    <li>also implicit bracing for single child elements, which would be super nice</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>need to understand how to identify keywords
                <ul>
                    <li>in html anything inside the brackets is a keyword
                         it could be anything (and should be)</li>
                    <li>aha! but all strings are in quotes, so everything not in "" must be a keyword</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>but it totally needs to not give a shit about whitespace, which html currently does
                <ul>
                    <li>like really none at all. so that way "p.code" and "p .code" are the same (think newline)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>and strings should all be in "" not out in the open</li>
            <li>maybe if I get really good I can induce function calls or macros and then a standard library
                <ul>
                    <li>for example, a function that generates the information in the head tag</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>and then I can have fun making my own extensions for vscode and notepad++ for the world to enjoy!</li>
            <li>also, lets fix h1, h2,... they are so stupid.  lets just create a general header tag with an attribute specific to rutwm</li>
            <li>and apparently, fix tabbing; make \t and \n a thing too</li>
            <li>I want to make a shortcut for defining fonts, just like you do padding and border</li>
            <li>making lists is stupid it should just know the scope its in.  just start an li tag and roll with it</li>
            <li>output should not have too much in a single line</li>
            <li>should be an option in the compiler to space everything or smack everything in a single line</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>things about the compiler</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>so so so much wrong with it (and good too I guess)
                <ul>
                    <li>preprocesses a "token" file and then rereads it</li>
                    <li>strings are not treated as a single token that remebers newlines and spacing <br>
                        which is useful for the style and script tags which should be ultimately untouched</li>
                    <li>python does a <strong>shitty</strong> job reading a file.  java did a spectacular job by comparison
                        <ul>
                            <li>I will need to make my own object that reads through the file a character at a time</li>
                            <li>need to take care of the "next token" "last token" "look ahead" type functions ahead of time</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>All that shit is fixed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>things to do now that I have a working compiler</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>user defined variables
                <ul>
                    <li>needs to be done after string processing (escape characters, bold, italics)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>user defined tags
                <ul>
                    <li>first, simple tags that just hold attribute information (can overwrite existing html tags) <br>
                        a(x) -> b(x)
                    </li>
                    <li>next, compound tags that have a single tag within a single tag <br>
                        a(x) -> b(c(...f(g(x))...))
                    </li>
                    <li>next, compound tags that have multiple tags within a single tag, still only one is variable <br>
                        a(x) -> b(c,d(x))
                    </li>
                    <li>next, compound variables tags <br>
                        a(x,y,z) -> b(c(d,e(x)),f(y),g(z))
                    </li>
                </ul>
